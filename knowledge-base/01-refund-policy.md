# Refund Policy
**Document ID:** POL-REF-001  
**Last Updated:** January 15, 2025  
**Owner:** Customer Support & Policy Team  
**Status:** Active

## Overview
This policy outlines how refunds are processed for users of GothPay (our consumer payment app). All customer support agents and automated systems must follow these guidelines when handling refund requests.

## Standard Refund Eligibility

### Eligible for Refund
Users can request refunds in the following situations:
- **Unauthorized transactions**: User did not authorize the payment
- **Duplicate charges**: Same transaction processed multiple times
- **Service not received**: Paid for goods/services that were never delivered
- **Incorrect amount**: Charged more than the agreed amount
- **Merchant agreement**: Merchant has agreed to issue a refund

### NOT Eligible for Refund
The following situations do not qualify for refunds:
- **Buyer's remorse**: User changed their mind after completing payment
- **Gift payments**: Payments sent as gifts cannot be refunded
- **Payment to wrong recipient**: User sent money to incorrect person (user error)
- **Gambling or adult content**: Transactions for restricted categories
- **Payments older than 180 days**: Outside our dispute window

## Processing Timeline

### Standard Refunds
- **Merchant-initiated refunds**: 3-5 business days to user's original payment method
- **GothPay-initiated refunds**: 5-10 business days after investigation completion
- **Bank processing time**: Additional 1-3 business days depending on user's bank

### Expedited Refunds (Fraud Cases)
- **Provisional credit**: Within 1-2 business days for confirmed fraud
- **Final resolution**: Within 10 business days

## Refund Methods

### Original Payment Method
- **Credit/Debit card**: Refunded to the original card
- **Bank account**: Refunded to the linked bank account
- **GothPay balance**: Refunded to user's GothPay wallet

### Important Notes
- Users cannot choose a different refund method than their original payment method
- If original payment method is no longer valid (expired card, closed account), refund goes to GothPay balance
- Users can then transfer balance to a current payment method

## User Actions Required

### How Users Request Refunds
1. Open the transaction in their transaction history
2. Tap "Report a Problem"
3. Select reason for refund request
4. Provide supporting documentation (receipts, screenshots, communication with merchant)
5. Submit request

### Documentation Requirements
- **Unauthorized transactions**: Police report (for amounts over $500) or signed affidavit
- **Service not received**: Proof of non-delivery, tracking information, merchant communication
- **Incorrect amount**: Original agreement/invoice showing correct amount

## Investigation Process

### Review Timeline
- **Initial review**: Within 24 hours
- **Additional information requested**: User has 7 days to respond
- **Final decision**: Within 10 business days of complete submission

### Decision Communication
Users receive email and in-app notification with:
- Decision outcome (approved/denied)
- Reason for decision
- Expected refund timeline (if approved)
- Appeal process (if denied)

## Special Cases

### Partial Refunds
- Available when only part of transaction is disputed
- Must be approved by both merchant and GothPay
- Processing time same as standard refunds

### Recurring Payments
- Refunds do not automatically cancel future recurring payments
- User must separately cancel subscription/recurring payment
- Only the specific disputed transaction is refunded

### International Transactions

- May result in slight variance due to currency fluctuations
- Additional processing time: 7-14 business days

## Exceptions & Escalations

### Manager Approval Required
- Refunds over $5,000
- Refunds outside standard eligibility criteria
- Provisional credits before investigation completion
- Disputes older than 120 days (but within 180-day window)

### Fraud Team Involvement

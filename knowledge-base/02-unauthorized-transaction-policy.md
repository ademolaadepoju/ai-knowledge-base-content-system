**Last Updated:** December 10, 2024  
**Owner:** Fraud & Risk Team  
**Status:** Active

## Overview
This policy defines how GothPay handles reports of unauthorized transactions, including fraud, account takeover, and identity theft scenarios.

## What Qualifies as Unauthorized

### Unauthorized Transactions Include
- **Account takeover**: Someone gained access to user's account without permission
- **Stolen credentials**: Password, PIN, or biometric access compromised
- **Lost/stolen device**: Phone or device with GothPay access was stolen
- **Fraudulent account creation**: Someone created account using user's identity
- **Merchant fraud**: Merchant charged user without authorization

### NOT Considered Unauthorized
- **Family/friend access**: User shared credentials with someone who made a payment
- **Subscription forgot about**: User authorized recurring payment but forgot
- **Buyer's remorse**: User regrets a payment they intentionally made
- **Scam where user authorized**: User was tricked but still clicked "confirm payment"

## User Liability Protection

### Zero Liability (Full Protection)
Users are NOT liable for unauthorized transactions if:
- Reported within 60 days of transaction date
- User did not contribute to the unauthorized access (didn't share password)

### Limited Liability ($50 maximum)
Users may be liable for up to $50 if:
- Reported between 60-120 days after transaction

### Full Liability (No Protection)
Users ARE liable for unauthorized transactions if:
- Reported more than 120 days after transaction
- User intentionally shared account access
- User participated in fraud scheme
- User disputes legitimate authorized payments

## Reporting Process

## Merchant Disputes vs. Fraud

### When to Use This Policy
- **Unauthorized Transaction Policy**: User didn't authorize the payment at all
- Claim: "I never made this payment"

### When to Use Refund Policy
- **Refund Policy** (POL-REF-001): User authorized payment but has issue with merchant
- Claim: "I paid for this but didn't receive it" or "This isn't what I ordered"

### Gray Area: Subscription Forgot About

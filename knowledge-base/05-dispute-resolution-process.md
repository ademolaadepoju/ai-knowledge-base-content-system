## Peer-to-Peer Dispute Resolution

### Important Limitation
**GothPay does NOT reverse peer-to-peer payments except in fraud cases.**

Peer-to-peer (P2P) payments are like handing someone cash. Once sent, it's the recipient's money unless:
- Unauthorized transaction (fraud/account takeover)
- Payment was duplicate error by system (not user error)
- Recipient account doesn't exist (payment never completed)

### Common P2P Dispute Scenarios

#### Scenario A: Sent to Wrong Person (User Error)

**Example:** User meant to pay @JohnDoe but paid @JohnD0e instead

**GothPay's Position:**
- This is sender's error, not GothPay platform error
- GothPay cannot reverse payment or force recipient to return it
- This is civil matter between sender and recipient

**What We CAN Do:**
- Provide recipient's contact information (if they consent)
- Facilitate communication between parties via in-app messaging
- Provide transaction details for small claims court if needed

**What We CANNOT Do:**
- Force recipient to return money
- Reverse the transaction
- Hold recipient's account hostage until they return funds
- Share recipient's personal information without consent

**Recommended Steps for User:**
1. Contact recipient directly (via GothPay message or known contact info)
2. Politely explain the error and request return payment
3. If recipient refuses, this is civil matter - small claims court may be option
4. In future, always double-check recipient before confirming payment

#### Scenario B: Payment for Item/Service Between Individuals

**Example:** User paid friend $200 for concert tickets, but friend never delivered tickets

**GothPay's Position:**
- P2P payments are for personal transactions between people who know each other
- These payments have no buyer/seller protection (unlike merchant transactions)
- Dispute is between the two individuals, not involving GothPay

**What We CAN Do:**
- Document dispute details in case it escalates to fraud claim
- Suspend suspected scammer's account if pattern of behavior emerges
- Cooperate with law enforcement if criminal fraud reported

**What We CANNOT Do:**
- Investigate whether tickets were actually supposed to be delivered
- Determine who is "right" in the dispute
- Reverse payment based on broken promise

**Recommended Steps for User:**
1. Attempt to resolve directly with the other person
2. Document all communication (texts, emails, agreements)
3. If scam, file police report and report to GothPay fraud team
4. For future: use merchant/buyer protection platforms for non-personal transactions

#### Scenario C: Shared Expense Dispute

**Example:** Roommates split $800 rent. One paid their half via GothPay but other roommate disputes amount owed.

**GothPay's Position:**
- Payment was authorized by sender
- Disagreement about what was owed is separate from payment itself
- Civil dispute between roommates

**Resolution:**
- This is personal dispute outside GothPay's jurisdiction
- Payment was completed as sender intended
- Overpayment/underpayment disagreements must be resolved between parties

#### Scenario D: Loan Repayment Dispute

**Example:** User lent friend $500 via GothPay. Friend claims it was a gift, not a loan.

**GothPay's Position:**
- GothPay transaction notes don't constitute legal loan agreement
- Whether payment was gift vs. loan is legal matter, not payment platform matter
- Transaction completed as sender authorized

**What Users Should Know:**
- Never use P2P payment apps for formal loans without separate written agreement
- GothPay payment notes are NOT legally binding contracts
- Small claims court or mediation may be needed for resolution

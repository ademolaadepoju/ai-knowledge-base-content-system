## Quick Answers to Frequent Questions

### Payment Timing

**Q: How long does it take for my payment to arrive?**

A: Depends on payment method:
- **Instant transfer** (debit card): Arrives within minutes, 1.5% fee
- **Standard transfer** (bank account): 1-3 business days, free
- **GothPay balance**: Instant, free

**Q: It's been 3 days and my payment still shows "pending." What's wrong?**

A: Possible reasons:
- Bank processing delays (especially weekends/holidays)
- Recipient hasn't accepted payment yet (new users)
- Payment flagged for fraud review
- Recipient hasn't verified their account

Check transaction status in your History. If still pending after 5 business days, contact support.

**Q: Can I cancel a payment after I sent it?**

A: Only if it's still pending:
- **Pending:** Yes, tap transaction and select "Cancel Payment"
- **Completed:** No, payment is final. Contact recipient to request return.

### Fees

**Q: Does GothPay charge fees?**

A: Most transactions are free:
- **Free:** Standard bank transfers, GothPay balance payments, receiving money
- **1.5% fee:** Instant transfers (debit card)
- **3% fee:** Credit card payments
- **$0.25 + 2.9%:** Business/merchant transactions

**Q: Why was I charged a fee when you said it's free?**

A: Check if you selected instant transfer (debit card) instead of standard transfer (bank account). Instant costs 1.5%, standard is free.

**Q: Can I get the fee refunded?**

A: Fees are non-refundable, but you can:
- Cancel and resend as standard transfer (if payment still pending)
- Use GothPay balance for future payments (no fees)

### Account Limits

**Q: Why can't I send more than $500?**

A: Your account verification level determines limits:
- **Basic** (email + phone only): $500/week
- **Enhanced** (+ ID uploaded): $3,000/week
- **Premium** (+ SSN + bank verified): $10,000/week

Upgrade in Settings > Account > Verify Identity

**Q: When do weekly limits reset?**

A: Every Monday at 12:00 AM Pacific Time. You can see your remaining balance and reset date in Settings > Limits.

**Q: I'm verified but still hit a limit. Why?**

A: Possible reasons:
- Velocity limit: Too many transactions too quickly (security measure)
- New account limit: First 30 days may have additional restrictions
- Fraud prevention: Large/unusual transaction triggered review

Contact support if you believe it's an error.

### Payment Methods

**Q: What payment methods can I use?**

A: You can add:
- Debit cards (Visa, Mastercard, Discover, Amex)
- Credit cards (Visa, Mastercard, Discover, Amex) - 3% fee
- Bank accounts (via routing/account number or instant verification)
- GothPay balance (add funds then pay from balance)

**Q: Why won't my prepaid card work?**

A: Many prepaid cards don't support P2P payments. Try:
- Transfer prepaid card balance to bank account first
- Use different payment method
- Contact prepaid card issuer to enable P2P transactions

**Q: Can I use someone else's card?**

A: No. Payment methods must be in your legal name and registered to your address. Using someone else's card violates Terms of Service and may result in account suspension.

### Refunds

**Q: How do I get a refund?**

A: Depends on payment type:

**Merchant purchase:**
- Open transaction in History
- Tap "Report a Problem"
- Select reason and submit
- See full process: Refund Policy (POL-REF-001)

**Personal payment (to friend, family, etc.):**
- Contact recipient and ask them to send money back
- GothPay cannot force refunds on P2P payments
- See: Peer-to-Peer Dispute Resolution (PROC-DIS-001)

**Q: I paid the wrong person. Can you reverse it?**

A: Unfortunately no. P2P payments are like handing someone cash - once sent, it's theirs. You can:
- Contact them and politely request return payment
- Report to fraud team if you suspect scam
- Future prevention: Always double-check recipient before confirming

**Q: How long do refunds take?**

A: After refund is approved:
- **GothPay balance:** Instant

- **Bank account:** 5-10 business days

### Security & Fraud

**Q: Someone sent me money I didn't request. Is it a scam?**

A: Possibly. Common scam tactics:
- Scammer sends you money, then claims it was "accidental" and asks you to send it back
- Real money sent from stolen account, but their return payment request uses fake method
- **DO NOT send money back directly.** Instead:
  - Don't touch the payment
  - Report to GothPay fraud team
  - Let GothPay investigate and reverse if fraudulent

**Q: I think someone accessed my account. What should I do immediately?**

A: 
1. **Lock your account:** Settings > Security > Lock Account (or call 1-800-GOTH-911)
2. **Change password:** On a secure device
3. **Enable 2FA:** If not already on
4. **Review transactions:** Check for unauthorized payments
5. **Report fraud:** File unauthorized transaction report

See full process: Unauthorized Transaction Policy (POL-UNT-002)

**Q: Do I need 2-factor authentication?**

A: Highly recommended but technically optional for Basic accounts. However:
- Required for Enhanced and Premium accounts
- Required after any security incident
- Required for transactions over $1,000
- Significantly reduces fraud risk

Enable in Settings > Security > 2-Factor Authentication

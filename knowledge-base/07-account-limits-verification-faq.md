## Frequently Asked Questions

### Getting Verified

**Q: How long does verification take?**

A: Typical timelines:
- **Email/phone:** Instant (receive code within seconds)
- **ID verification:** 2-24 hours (usually within 2 hours)
- **Premium verification:** 2-3 business days

**Q: Why was my ID rejected?**

A: Common reasons:
- **Blurry photo:** Retake in good lighting, all text must be readable
- **Expired ID:** Must be currently valid (not expired)
- **Wrong document type:** Must be government-issued (no student IDs, work badges)
- **Partial image:** All four corners of ID must be visible
- **Edited/cropped:** Submit original photo without filters or editing

Tips for good ID photos:
- Use phone camera (better than scanner)
- Place ID on dark, solid background
- Good lighting, no shadows or glare
- Hold camera directly above ID (not at angle)
- Include all edges of ID in frame

**Q: What if I don't have a driver's license?**

A: Other acceptable IDs:
- State ID card
- U.S. passport or passport card
- Permanent resident card (Green Card)
- Military ID

NOT acceptable:
- Social Security card
- Birth certificate
- Employee badges
- Student IDs
- Foreign IDs (unless Green Card)

**Q: Do I need to upload my SSN? Isn't that risky?**

A: SSN is only required for Premium accounts (optional for most users).

Security measures:
- Encrypted storage (256-bit AES)
- Only last 4 digits visible to employees
- Never shown in app interface
- Used solely for IRS reporting and fraud prevention
- Can request deletion if you close account

You're NOT required to provide SSN unless you want Premium level.

### Understanding Limits

**Q: When do limits reset?**

A: 
- **Weekly limits:** Every Monday at 12:00 AM Pacific Time
- **Monthly limits:** First day of each month at 12:00 AM Pacific Time

You can see your current usage and reset date in Settings > Account > Limits

**Q: What counts toward my sending limit?**

A: All outgoing payments:
- Payments to individuals
- Payments to businesses/merchants
- Instant transfers to your bank (these count as "sending")

What does NOT count:
- Receiving money
- Standard (non-instant) bank transfers out
- Refunds you receive

**Q: What if I need to send more than my limit allows?**

A: Options:
- **Upgrade verification level:** Get higher limits permanently
- **Wait for reset:** Limits reset weekly
- **Split payment:** Send across multiple weeks
- **Use different method:** Bank transfer, wire, check
- **Temporary increase:** Not available; must upgrade tier

**Q: Can I get a one-time limit exception for emergency?**

A: Generally no. Verification tiers exist for regulatory compliance (anti-money laundering laws).

Rare exceptions (requires manager approval):
- Medical emergency with documentation
- Natural disaster affecting your area
- Verified time-sensitive situation

Contact escalations@gothpay.com with documentation.

### Verification Problems

**Q: I uploaded my ID but it's still pending after 48 hours.**

A: This usually means manual review is required. Common reasons:
- ID from certain states requires extra verification (NY, TX, CA)
- Name on ID doesn't match name on account
- Address on ID significantly different from registered address
- Quality concerns (poor photo)

Check your email for requests for additional information. If nothing received, contact support.

**Q: My ID shows my old address. Will that cause problems?**

A: Usually fine as long as:
- ID is not expired
- Name matches your account name
- You provide current address separately in account settings

We verify identity (name + DOB), not current address from ID.

**Q: I legally changed my name. How do I update my account?**

A: Submit:
- New ID with updated name
- Legal name change documentation (marriage certificate, court order)
- Upload via Settings > Account > Update Legal Name

Review takes 3-5 business days. Account may be limited during review.

**Q: What if my ID is in a different name than I go by?**

A: Account must use your legal name (as appears on government ID) for compliance.

However:
- Display name can be different (what friends see)
- $GothTag can be different (your username)
- Legal name only seen by GothPay and required for tax/legal purposes

## Receiving Limits

**Q: Why do I have a receiving limit? I'm not sending money.**

A: Anti-money laundering regulations require limits on ALL money movement, including receiving.

**Q: Someone is trying to send me money but it's declined. Why?**

A: Check if you've hit your weekly receiving limit:
- Basic: $1,000/week
- Enhanced: $10,000/week
- Premium: Unlimited

Limits reset Monday 12 AM PT. Upgrade verification to increase.

**Q: Does receiving money affect my sending limit?**

A: No, they're separate limits:
- **Sending limit:** How much you can pay out
- **Receiving limit:** How much you can receive

## Business & High-Volume Use

**Q: I need to receive more than $10,000/week for my business. What do I do?**

A: Apply for Business Account:
- Different verification requirements (EIN, business docs)
- Higher limits (or unlimited with approval)
- Business-specific features (invoicing, payment links)
- Different fee structure (2.9% + $0.25)

Apply: gothpay.com/business or Settings > Upgrade to Business

**Q: Can I use my personal account for business?**

A: No. Terms of Service require Business Account for:
- Selling goods or services
- Receiving payments for work/freelancing
- Any commercial activity

Using personal account for business may result in:
- Account suspension
- Funds held
- IRS reporting complications
- Fee violations

**Q: I freelance occasionally. Do I need a Business Account?**

A: Depends on volume:
- **Occasional (< $600/year from one source):** Personal account acceptable
- **Regular income:** Should use Business Account
- **Over $600/year from single source:** Business Account required (IRS Form 1099-K)

When in doubt, use Business Account to avoid complications.

## Tax & Reporting

**Q: Will GothPay report my transactions to the IRS?**

A: Required by law to report if:
- **Business Account:** Gross payments over $600/year
- **Personal Account:** Should not receive business income

We send Form 1099-K to qualifying users and IRS.

**Q: I received a 1099-K but I don't think I should have. What do I do?**

A: Common reasons for unexpected 1099-K:
- Received business/commercial payments on personal account
- Family/friends marked payments as "goods & services"
- Exceeded $600 threshold without realizing

Contact support to review transactions and issue corrected 1099-K if error.

**Q: How do I avoid getting a 1099-K for personal payments?**

A: When receiving money, make sure sender marks it correctly:
- **Personal:** "Friends & Family," "Gift," "Reimbursement"
- **Business:** "Goods & Services," "Payment for Work"

Incorrect categorization can trigger unnecessary 1099-K.

## International & Travel

**Q: I'm traveling internationally. Will my account work?**

A: Limited functionality while abroad:
- **Can:** Check balance, view transactions
- **Can:** Receive money
- **Cannot:** Send money (location verification required)
- **Cannot:** Add new payment methods

**Q: Can I verify my account with a foreign ID if I'm not a U.S. citizen?**

A: Must have U.S.-issued ID:
- U.S. passport
- State driver's license/ID
- Permanent resident card (Green Card)
- Military ID

Foreign passports not accepted, even for temporary U.S. residents.

**Q: I'm a U.S. citizen living abroad. Can I use GothPay?**

- Provide U.S. address (not P.O. Box)
- Use U.S. phone number
- May need VPN to appear in U.S. (check Terms regarding VPN use)

If you've permanently moved abroad, GothPay may not be available.

## Troubleshooting Verification

**Q: I submitted verification documents weeks ago and still nothing. What now?**

A: Escalate to verification team:
1. Email: verification@gothpay.com
2. Include: Account email, approximate submission date, type of documents submitted
3. Expect response within 2 business days

**Q: My account was downgraded from Enhanced to Basic. Why?**

A: Possible reasons:
- ID expired (check expiration date on your ID)
- Failed periodic re-verification (required annually)
- Name/address mismatch flagged in audit
- Suspicious activity required re-verification

Check email for notification. Re-submit verification documents to restore.

**Q: Can I verify someone else's account for them (elderly parent, disabled person)?**

A: No. Each person must verify their own identity.

For those needing assistance:
- You can help them take photos and submit documents
- But ID must be theirs, not yours
- Video verification available for accessibility needs
- Power of Attorney may enable account management (contact legal team)

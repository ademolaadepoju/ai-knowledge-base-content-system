## Crypto Wallet Security

### Your GothPay Crypto Wallet

**Custody:**

- Similar to how GothPay holds your USD balance

**Security Measures:**
- Multi-signature wallets
- Cold storage for majority of funds
- Insurance for hot wallet holdings (up to $500k aggregate)
- Regular security audits

**Important:**
- "Not your keys, not your crypto" - GothPay controls the private keys
- If GothPay experiences breach, your crypto could be at risk
- Consider moving large holdings to personal hardware wallet

### Security Best Practices

**Protect Your Account:**
- Enable 2FA (REQUIRED for crypto beta)
- Use strong, unique password
- Never share account credentials
- Review account activity regularly
- Enable transaction notifications

**When Sending:**
- Always verify wallet addresses character-by-character
- Test with small amount to new addresses
- Be aware of phishing scams requesting crypto
- Never send crypto to someone pressuring you

## Risks & Disclaimers

### Price Volatility

**Crypto Prices Fluctuate:**
- Can gain or lose 10-50% in single day
- No FDIC insurance for crypto holdings
- Past performance ≠ future results

**Example:**
- Buy $1,000 of Bitcoin today
- Tomorrow it could be worth $1,200 or $800
- Only invest what you can afford to lose

### No Buyer/Seller Protection

**Unlike Regular GothPay Payments:**
- ✗ No refund policy for crypto purchases/sales
- ✗ No dispute resolution for crypto transfers
- ✗ No unauthorized transaction protection (if you sent it, it's gone)
- ✗ No recourse if recipient doesn't deliver goods

**Crypto Transactions Are Final:**
- Cannot be reversed under any circumstances
- If you send to wrong address → lost forever
- If scammed → GothPay cannot recover funds

### Regulatory Uncertainty

**Crypto Regulations Evolving:**
- Laws may change, affecting availability
- GothPay may need to modify or discontinue crypto features
- Tax treatment could change
- Some states banning or heavily regulating crypto

**Beta Risks:**
- Features may be removed without notice

## Conflicts with Standard GothPay Policies

### ⚠️ IMPORTANT: How Crypto Differs from Regular Payments

**Standard GothPay Payments:**
- Refundable (under Refund Policy POL-REF-001)
- Dispute resolution available (PROC-DIS-001)
- Fraud protection (POL-UNT-002)
- Reversible if unauthorized

**Cryptocurrency Payments:**
- **NOT refundable** (no exceptions)
- **NO dispute resolution** (blockchain is final)
- **NO fraud protection** (you are responsible)
- **NOT reversible** (ever)

### Which Policy Applies?

**If You:**
- Pay merchant with USD via GothPay → Standard policies apply
- Pay merchant with crypto via GothPay → Crypto policies apply (NO refunds/disputes)

**Example Scenario:**
- You buy concert tickets from merchant for $200
- Payment method 1: USD from GothPay balance → If tickets not delivered, file dispute for refund
- Payment method 2: Crypto from GothPay wallet → If tickets not delivered, NO recourse (crypto gone forever)

**GothPay's Recommendation:**
Use standard USD payments for purchases. Use crypto only for:
- Investment/speculation
- Transfers to trusted recipients
- Situations where finality is desired

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I participate in the beta?**
A: Only by invitation. Cannot self-enroll. Invitations sent to eligible Premium accounts randomly.

**Q: What happens if GothPay discontinues crypto?**
A: You'll have 30 days notice to withdraw crypto to external wallet or sell for USD.

**Q: Is my crypto FDIC insured?**
A: No. Only USD balances are FDIC insured (up to $250k). Crypto has limited insurance coverage (see Security section).

**Q: Can I get a refund if crypto price drops after I buy?**
A: No. Price changes are your responsibility and risk.

**Q: What if I send crypto to wrong GothPay user by mistake?**
A: Contact recipient and request they return it. GothPay cannot reverse the transaction.

**Q: What if I send crypto to wrong external wallet address?**
A: Lost permanently. GothPay cannot recover. Always double-check addresses.

**Q: Do I need to report crypto to IRS if I only bought and held (didn't sell)?**
A: Buying alone is not taxable event. But check IRS Form 1040 question about crypto - you must answer truthfully even if just holding.

**Q: Can I use crypto for business transactions on GothPay?**
A: Not currently. Crypto beta is personal accounts only. Business support coming later (maybe).

**Q: What's the difference between this and Coinbase or other crypto exchanges?**
A: GothPay crypto is integrated with your payment account (easy to move between USD and crypto). Standalone exchanges may have lower fees but more complex.

**Q: Can I send crypto internationally?**
A: To external wallets, yes (blockchain has no borders). To other GothPay users, only if they're also in U.S. and in beta.
